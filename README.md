<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>This project demonstrates the application of machine learning and data analytics using R to analyze wine quality data. 
The analysis involves downloading and preparing the dataset, checking for missing values, partitioning the data into training and test sets, 
and performing detailed analysis on various chemical properties of the wine. Key variables such as acidity, chlorides, sulfur dioxide, 
and alcohol content are examined for their impact on wine quality. The project utilizes Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and 
Random Forest models to predict wine quality, achieving a test RMSE of 0.53 and an overall accuracy of 70%.</p>
